## The Basics
The formal definition of a circle is the set of all points that are equidistant from a _center_ point. So, in order to draw a circle, you have to plot all of the points that are a specific distance away from the center point. This specific distance is called the **radius**.\
The **diameter** of a circle is a straight line that goes through the center of a circle and touches two points. The diameter of a circle is equal to twice the radius.\
The **circumference** of a circle is equal to the distance around the circle.\
π, which used in many circle equations, is roughly equal to 3.14, but the SAT will usually want you to leave the π as is. For example, if you get an answer like 2π, the answer in the multipe choice options will be printed as 2π.

Although the following equations are given on the SAT, I highly recommend that you memorize as it will allow you to not waste time flipping to the formula page.

Circumference = \\(2 x π x radius)
Diameter = \\(2 x radius)
Area = \\(π x radius^2)

Here is an illustration to help visualize.

Degrees, which are represented using a little circle (°), are used to measure angles. There are 360 degrees in one full circle.

Here is an image of the angle measurements of a circle:

So, angles, which are measured in degrees, are used to describe a portion of a circle.
