There are already many guides online that teach the specific formulas, definitions, and facts that you need to know for the SAT and ACT. I believe that most of us already know a good portion of these things, but have trouble applying them when taking tricky standardized tests. Instead of just writing about the things you need to know to do well on the tests, I think it would be a lot more beneficial if I go through specific problems and show the entire process by which I arrive at answers. As people ask me questions about SAT and ACT problems nthrough Discord, email, or the comments section below, I will continue to add more problems to a compilation of questions I intend on creating. Finally, once I have shown how to solve a significant amount of problems, I will take the knowledge that I believe helped me the most in solving those problems and write a post that elaborates on the most important things to know for for each type of problem. 

This is a concept that I just thought up of off the top of my head. I don't know whether this is a good idea that will appeal to readers. Please let me know through Discord, email, the reddit post, or the comment section below whether you approve of this idea and encourage me to go forth with it.

<!--## The Basics
The formal definition of a circle is the set of all points that are equidistant from a _center_ point. So, in order to draw a circle, you have to plot all of the points that are a specific distance away from the center point. This specific distance is called the **radius**.\
The **diameter** of a circle is a straight line that goes through the center of a circle and touches two points. The diameter of a circle is equal to twice the radius.\
The **circumference** of a circle is equal to the distance around the circle.\
π, which used in many circle equations, is roughly equal to 3.14, but the SAT will usually want you to leave the π as is. For example, if you get an answer like 2π, the answer in the multipe choice options will be printed as 2π.
Although the following equations are given on the SAT, I highly recommend that you memorize as it will allow you to not waste time flipping to the formula page.
Circumference = \\(2 x π x radius)
Diameter = \\(2 x radius)
Area = \\(π x radius^2)
Here is an illustration to help visualize.

Degrees, which are represented using a little circle (°), are used to measure angles. There are 360 degrees in one full circle.
Here is an image of the angle measurements of a circle:

So, angles, which are measured in degrees, are used to describe a portion of a circle.
