I will try to go through each type of reading question on the SAT and give a strategy to solve each. Make sure to comment, email, or message on Discord if you there is anything you would like to recommend me to add.

Understanding advanced writing is not something that can easily be taught. It is a skill that is attained through lots of practice. If you feel that you are missing points on the reading portion because you are misunderstanding parts of the passages, I highly recommend that you begin to read from these website regularly
