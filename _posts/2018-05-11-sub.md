Imagine running into this on the test. Maybe you’re like me and haven’t practiced polynomial division in over a year, or you’re in an algebra class and haven’t gotten to the topic yet. Regardless, you’re stumped. The coveted 800 math score might feel further away than ever. Don’t fret. The nature of this problem makes an approach alternate to long and synthetic division effective: picking values of x. The key word here is “equivalent.” This means that you can arbitrarily substitute a number for x and eliminate any expressions that, when evaluated, differ from the expression given in the question. For example, choosing to make x equal to 0 will eliminate answer choices B and C. They evaluate to -5/3 and 11/3 respectively while the expression given in the question evaluates to 5/3. Now all that remain are A and D, which both evaluate to 5/3 for x is 0. One of the two is wrong, and the wrong answer can be eliminated by picking another value for x, such as 1. Substituting x for 1 in the first expression yields 3. A evaluates to 1 and D evaluates to 3. The value of D matches the value of the first expression, thus D is the correct answer. 

This method can be applied to more problems. Consider the following:

Applying the same process to this problem is particularly tedious, because there is an extra operation to do for the first expression. However, if factoring f(x) and g(x) is difficult, picking values for x will lead to the correct answer. Let’s choose 4, which satisfies the restraint x > 3. f(4)/g(4) evaluates to 28/5, A evaluates to 1/5, B evaluates to 7/5, C evaluates to 4/5, and D evaluates to 28/5. D is the only answer choice that is equivalent to f(x)/g(x) for x is 4, thus the correct answer is D.

I hope this post has been helpful to you. If you have any questions, need any help, or have found mistakes, please let me know on discord or in the comments. Thanks, and good luck on the SAT grind!
