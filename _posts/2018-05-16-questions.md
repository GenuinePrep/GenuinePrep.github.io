Hello guys, in this post, I'll be going over some of the types of questions you will encounter on SAT reading and will give some tips on solving each of them. This post is a work-in-progress so I'll be adding more content in the future

### Line References
Many questions on the SAT reading will ask you to pick a line that supports the answer you gave in a previous question. Lets call the original question #1 and the question that asks for evidence for your previous answer #2. If you are having difficulty finding the answer to #1, **read all the lines that are mentioned in the answer options for #2. The answer to #1 can be found in the lines for one of the answer options in #2! Once you determine the correct answer, you will have answers to both #1 and #2.** 


### General Theme Questions
These questions will essentially ask you to sum up a passage as a whole, and are worded like "Which choice best summarizes this passage?","Which choice describes a major theme of this passage?", or something to that effect. 
To answer, I try to make a quick summary in my head and pick the answer that best fits the summary I have made. Take for example question one on <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sat-practice-test-7.pdf">SAT Practice Test #7</a> question #1. Read the passage and try to sum it up in a short sentence or two before picking an answer. For me, I summed up the passage as "guy who's obsessed with money gets a life thanks to a little girl." 
This may sound somehwat silly, but it summarizes the entire passage quite well. Now when I go to look at the answer choices, I can instantly rule out C because "childhood naïveté" is not discussed in the passage. B is also easily ruled out because the passage does not discuss the morality of children to any degree. Thus, we are left with two questions. I can rule out A because although Silas' materialistic nature is discussed, the idea of the passage is not Silas' greed itself, but how his daughter helps him understand that money is not all there is to life. I pick D because it is the only one that discusses Silas' relationship with Eppie, which is what the passage itself does.
