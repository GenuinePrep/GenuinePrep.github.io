### Every Answer is Uncontestably Correct
The College Board would never publish a test unless they were 100% sure that the answers to each of their questions is undoubtedly correct. How do they do this? By making the three incorrect options undoubtedly wrong. **Each wrong answer can be proven to be incorrect.** The reasons for incorrectness often fall into one of these categories, according to Erica L. Meltzer:

* Off-topic, not related to passage
* Too broad
* Too extreme. For example, if the passage is written fairly neutrally, but the answer is overly positive or negative
* One part of the answer is correct, but the other half is wrong
* Is conjecture (could be true but not enough information to prove it)
* True for entire passage but not the line the question is focusing on
* Factually true, but not mentioned in the passage

Make sure to watch out for answer choices that fit one of the descriptions above. Often times, you'll get stuck with two seemingly viable answers. By finding which of the two meet the criteria above, you'll be able to find the correct answer.
