<!--<center>Genuine Prep was created by Ahmed, a high school junior. While preparing for standardized tests, he was frustrated by the expensive classes, mediocre teaching, and low-quality materials that made studying for the tests far too difficult. By creating this free site, Ahmed hopes to aid future test-takers in avoiding these difficulties.</center>-->

## Features of Genuine Prep

# This site was created and is updated by Ahmed, a high school student who scored a 35 on the ACT and a 1590 on the SAT.
