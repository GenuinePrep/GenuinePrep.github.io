Hi, I'm Ahmed. Logical is my private tutoring service for SAT Math.

### Who Am I?
* I have a perfect score of 800 on the SAT Math section.
* I currently hold an Associate's Degree in Mathematics. 
* I've tutored at Washtenaw Community College for the past two years.

### Why Me?

* Expertise: I am passionate about mathematics and can help students *understand* concepts rather than simply having them memorize formulas. Additionally, I know the test strategies that are necessary to get a great score. Lastly, I have two years of experience in tutoring and know how to work with students of various academic backgrounds.

* Customized Lessons: I understand that every person has unique strengths and weaknesses and create lessons with that in mind. Before tutoring a student, I look over a test he or she has taken in the past so that I can design a lesson that fits his or her needs.

* Flexible Hours: I work around students' schedules to set up sessions at the most convenient times possible.

* Satisfaction Guaranteed: My first lesson is free, so there's no risk in trying out Logical.

### Additional Information
* Standard rate is $25 per hour
* Sessions are held in a public space like a library
* You can contact me at logicalprep@outlook.com
