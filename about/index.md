<!--<center>Genuine Prep was created by Ahmed, a high school junior. While preparing for standardized tests, he was frustrated by the expensive classes, mediocre teaching, and low-quality materials that made studying for the tests far too difficult. By creating this free site, Ahmed hopes to aid future test-takers in avoiding these difficulties.</center>-->

## Features of Genuine Prep
* Completely free and not-for-profit
* No ads
* High quality posts
* Discord chat for real-time answers to your test questions
* Content is curated by 99th percentile test scorers

### This site was created and is updated by Ahmed, a high school student who scored a 35 on the ACT and a 1590 on the SAT. He was stuck with crappy internet for a couple of weeks so he made this instead of playing video games.
