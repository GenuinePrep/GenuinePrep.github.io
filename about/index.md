<center>Genuine Prep was created by Ahmed, a high school junior. While preparing for standardized tests, he was frustrated by the expensive classes, mediocre teaching, and low-quality materials that made studying for the tests far too difficult. By creating this free site, Ahmed hopes to aid future test-takers in avoiding these difficulties.</center>

## Features of Genuine Prep
* Completely free
* No ads
* High quality posts
* Discord chat for real-time answers to your test questions
* Curated by Ahmed and Matthew, 99th-percentile scorers on the ACT and SAT
