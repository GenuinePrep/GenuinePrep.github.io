<center>Genuine Prep was created by Ahmed and run in collaboration with Matthew. Both are high school juniors with exceptional ACT and SAT scores. While preparing for these standardized tests, Ahmed and Matthew were frustrated by the expensive classes, mediocre teaching, and low-quality materials that made studying for the tests overly difficult. By creating this free site, Ahmed and Matthew hope to aid future test-takers in avoiding these difficulties.</center>

## Features of Genuine Prep
* Completely free
* No ads
* High quality posts that truly teach the content on the tests
* Discord chat for real-time answers
* Run by 99th percentile scorers
